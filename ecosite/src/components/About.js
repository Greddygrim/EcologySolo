      <p>
        ECO-FUNK is a Non-Profit Organization dedicated to protecting the
        environment in the Pacific states of California, Oregon, & Washington.
        We believe the entire eco-systems, the environment, and the bio-sphere
        are under attack. We must not stand still and allow the wholesale
        destruction of mother nature. Itâ€™s time we stand up. We must never
        underestimate the impact that extraordinary individuals can have on
        society. Every small act can be a building block to the greater good.
        The first step is pledging to signup with an account. This benefit is
        that it puts you on our mailing list and will enable you to interact
        with the features we plan to add to this site.{" "}
